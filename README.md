# soil-moisture-project
Irrigation is the main problem in agriculture in the countries which are in developing stage. 

The main cause is low rainfall due to this more land is not irrigated. Another very important 

reason is unplanned usage of water resources by this way more water gets wasted. By the 

drip system, water is supplied to the plant zone only thus saving a large amount of water. 

Automatic irrigation system can supply water to plants whenever they are in need of water 

at regular power supply intervals. Here no need of turning ON/OFF of valves.

 
By this automatic irrigation system, watering plants at exact time based on soil condition 

which will improve crop growth by taking water and minerals from soil when needed. The 

aim of the project is to create a sensor network based on low cost soil moisture, 

temperature monitoring system which helps to track the moisture of the soil and 

temperature in real time and allow water to the plants based on the detecting values and 

the type of crop.

The sensors detects the values and provide it to the Arduino microcontroller. It converts 

these values into its appropriate form that is executing in it and gives the output in the form 

water flow according to the input values. In case, critical situation is detected through these 

sensors then a gmail is sent to the owner. A sensor is a device which is used to detect any 

changes in the environment and send information to the processor. The sensors in this 

project are as follows:

• Soil moisture sensor

• Temperature sensor(DHT-11)





					
2.Executive Summary:  

The Smart Garden System is an introductory, easy to build Raspberry Pi based environmental 

monitoring and plant watering system using advanced sensors to monitor the soil moisture, 

monitor the sunlight, watch the air quality and monitor temperature and humidity. It is 

designed to be easily and simply put together and tested with No Soldering Required!  The 

smart garden monitors the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture of the plant. It has an 

automated system that waters the plant when the soil is too dry and sends an email by a two 

second delay by the help of SMTP.
	

This maintains an ideal and consistent soil condition for the plant and makes it convenient for 

those who tend to forget to water their plants regularly. Also, the plant can continuously 

photosynthesize even when there is no sunlight. We will be using a Raspberry Pi to receive 

data from the sensors and control the different actuators. The surrounding temperature, air 

humidity and brightness values will be recorded, as well as the soil moisture levels. These 

values are analysed by various parameters, which allow users to know the environmental 

conditions of the plants when they check on them.
